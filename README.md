# Ultragreen - Greenhouse Project

The main objective of this project is to design and construct a
remote-control system that will keep the temperature and humidity in a controlled space to oneâ€™s
desired level. The project will make use of two Arduino boards. This project's goal is to create a
wireless temperature and humidity controller. This will be accomplished by using two Arduino Mega
boards and a nRF24L01 transceiver module to communicate wirelessly between the two devices.
